# Surfs Up
## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather additional data for our higher ups. The specific data requested was June and December temperature information  in Oahu in order to determine the level of sustainability in the surf and ice cream shop year round.
## Results
### Three key differences in weather between June and December
- While the temperatures are roughly similar (give or take 5 degrees), December has overall lower temperatures, as seen in this comparison image:

- The biggest difference was the lowest temperature average. June's lowest recorded temperature was 64°. and December's lowest was 56°.
- Another key difference was the amount of data recorded, as June has a count of 1700 and December has a count of just over 1500.

## Summary of results
### Additional Queries
- I feel this analysis needs more data to provide better actionable insights for the highers ups. One additional query I would run to get that data is a more indepth analysis on rainfall. Our previous analysis just looked for months with higher rates of percipitation but I would do an analysis on extreme weather. If June or December (or any month for that matter) has a torrential rain fall season/hurricanes, then it would be useful to prepare for and anticipate the adverse affects of that.
- The second query I would run would to look at competitors methods for handling the variety of weather conditions. This would look like running a webscrape or query to get competitors who have shops on each of the islands and their open and closed hours and season. It would also be helpful to view their revenue so we can get an idea on what we might make from a venture like this. This data would help us set up shop in the most ideal shop and prepare for all kinds of situations.
